# How have you started your GitHub project?  
## Did you create a .gitignore to avoid committing files that don't belong in version control?  
## Did you make sure NO .idea files are in your GitHub repository?

I created a .gitignore file to avoid committing files that don’t belong in version control and made sure that including me, no one in my team is committing .idea files. In the event that someone does accidentally push a .idea file since we have branches, it would not affect the code in the main branch.

# How do you manage commits to avoid problems?  
To manage commits we split each team member to work on their own individual branches. At the end of the week, we make pull requests to double-check that the code that is going to be merged with the main runs properly. This way if a team member accidentally commits broken code, it will only affect their branch and if not noticed immediately, it will be obvious through a pull request. Only when the code in a branch is guaranteed to be clean with no errors will the branch be merged with the main.
