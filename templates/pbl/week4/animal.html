    <h2>Impacts of Natural Disasters: Animals</h2>
    <p>Animals living in the wild are particularly vulnerable in natural disasters. Earthquakes, hurricanes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, and forest fires can have devastating consequences. Many animals die, drowned or buried alive by dirt, ash, lava, or snow; crushed to death in collapsed or burnt burrows; smashed against trees and rocks, or pelted by hailstones. Others sustain major injuries, including cuts and abrasions to the eyes, wings and gills; respiratory and digestive disorders, eroded teeth; malnutrition; and poisoning from contaminated food and water. Strong volcanic eruptions and fires can temporarily change regional weather, cooling or heating the air, changing winds, or causing rain. Volcanoes, storms, and floods can kill marine animals directly, or cause long-term problems by depositing debris and affecting the temperature and salinity of water. All of this contributes to health problems for marine animals, while changing the circulation of water, which further affects nutrient availability and water temperature.
